# Pixel.Tools
Complete Pixel-Art editor with peer to peer collaboration features

These are all the files required to run Pixel.Tools on your system.  
The pixel editor can also be used online at https://prominentdetail.github.io/Pixel.Tools/

Collaboration on this project is welcome.  
What probably needs priority is cleaning up a lot of the code and making things more efficient.
